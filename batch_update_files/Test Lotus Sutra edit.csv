Or.8210/S.1227	"Saddharmapundarikasutra (Lotus Sutra), Chinese translation by Kumarajiva from Dunhuang."	"This scroll fragment is made of four and a half sheets of fine yellow paper: the first sheet is incomplete (the beginning of it is missing) and the end sheet of the original manuscript, with its distinctive shape, has been preserved. Traces of water damage and mould are visible throughout in the bottom half of the fragment. As indicated by the end title 觀音經一卷 (Guanyin jing yi juan) written on line 15 of the end sheet, this fragmentary scroll contains most of the Guanyin Sutra, which is based on Chapter 25 of the Lotus Sutra's translation in Chinese by Kumarajiva. The text starts at [...]力。多所饒益 ([...] li. duo suo rao yi). Each sheet of paper is roughly divided in 23 vertical lines of text that are laid within margins and guidelines, with 17 characters on average (up to 20 characters for the part in verse). On the verso, the incription “觀音經” in red, the number 'S.1227' that appears twice and the Suzhou numeral for '280', were all added in the twentieth century, after the manuscript was removed from Mogao Cave 17, near Dunhuang, China."
