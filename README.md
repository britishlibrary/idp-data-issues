## Overview
IDP use this Github repository (britishlibrary/idp-data-issues) to record and communicate around data problems. We use a Github repo because this provides a mechanism for storing reports, etcs, associated with a given issue. The underlying 4D code and data for the IDP site are NOT part of the repo.

Wiki pages internal to the repo are added and modified using Github in a browser: [https://github.com/britishlibrary/idp-data-issues/wiki](https://github.com/britishlibrary/idp-data-issues/wiki)

Issues pages internal to the repo are also added and modified using Github in a browser: [https://github.com/britishlibrary/idp-data-issues/issues](https://github.com/britishlibrary/idp-data-issues/issues)

A separate shared Excel sheet is also used for recording issues: [https://gbr01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/ap/x-59584e83/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbluk.sharepoint.com%2F%3Ax%3A%2Fs%2FPRJ_InternationalDunhuangProjectWebsiteUpdate%2FEUCIQwcbyQRIorutgvX-K5EB_y0agjP5WuE_58pJvNa7xQ%3Fe%3Dkpk0Ix&data=05%7C01%7C%7C6dfa788750d245037c1a08db4190a3ed%7C21a44cb7f9c34f009afabd1e8e88bcd9%7C0%7C0%7C638175861692745662%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=LtS77SsFTOB48nzDqPKR7iJNnahipNhBNzD6C%2BuXwOk%3D&reserved=0](IDP website issues log v.1.0.xlsx)
