## Overview
IDP use this Github repository (britishlibrary/idp-data-issues) to record and communicate around data problems. We use a Github repo because this provides a mechanism for storing reports, etcs, associated with a given issue. The underlying 4D code and data for the IDP site are NOT part of the repo.
